# AnomalyDetection
My attempt at an implementation of the anomaly detection algorithm in Machine Learning. This is inspired by Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera.

This includes a simple web interface that allows one to upload CSV files. The features are the following:

Allows the user to generate histograms for each feature in the CSV file. This is helpful for checking if the feature in question is from a normal distribution.
Allows the user to apply logarithmic, square root, and cube root transformations to their features.
Implements an anomaly detection algorithm that will allow the user to know the normal samples and anomalous samples from their dataset.
